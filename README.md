The updated UNav features:

-	A new banner explaining how to identify an official NY.gov site and how to know that a site is secure, helping visitors understand the site is an official New York State government site;
-	The service links have been removed from the top to simplify the interface and help visitors stay on task;
-	The translation menu/language switcher was integrated into the banner to take up less vertical space on the page;
-	Search was incorporated more naturally into the design of the UNav;
-	Mobile-responsiveness has been improved: translation and search features expand to fill larger screens, but collapse on smaller screens to save space.
