# NY State Universal Navigation (UNav)

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repo is still in beta. There will be more technical implementation details and demos coming in the next few weeks.

The updated version of the New York State Universal Navigation (UNav) is set to launch on October 1, 2024, bringing significant improvements to the digital experience across all public-facing NYS websites. This update aligns with federal standards for accessibility and security, ensuring a more consistent and trustworthy user experience.

The update UNav features:

-	A new banner explaining how to identify an official NY.gov site and how to know that a site is secure, helping visitors understand the site is an official New York State government site;
-	The service links have been removed from the top to simplify the interface and help visitors stay on task;
-	The translation menu/language switcher was integrated into the banner to take up less vertical space on the page;
-	Search was incorporated more naturally into the design of the UNav;
-	Mobile-responsiveness has been improved: translation and search features expand to fill larger screens, but collapse on smaller screens to save space.

These updates reflect New York State’s dedication to creating a secure, accessible, and user-friendly online experience for everyone.

This is what the updated UNav looks like:
