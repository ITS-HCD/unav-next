# NY State Universal Navigation (UNav)

The updated version of the New York State Universal Navigation (UNav) is set to launch on October 1, 2024, bringing significant improvements to the digital experience across all public-facing NYS websites. This update aligns with federal standards for accessibility and security, ensuring a more consistent and trustworthy user experience.

- Enhanced User Trust: The updated UNav includes a banner that clearly identifies official NY.gov sites, assuring users they are connected to a secure and legitimate government website.
- Streamlined Navigation: Confusing service links have been removed, making it easier for users to find what they need without distractions.
- Integrated Features: The new UNav incorporates a built-in translation selector and search functionality, both of which are optimized for responsiveness across devices.

These changes are part of New York Stateâ€™s commitment to delivering exceptional digital services that are secure, accessible, and easy to use.
